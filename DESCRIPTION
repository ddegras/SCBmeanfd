Description: Statistical methods for estimating and inferring the mean of functional data. The methods include simultaneous confidence bands (parametric/nonparametric bootstrap + Gaussian kinematic formula), local polynomial fitting,  bandwidth selection by plug-in and cross-validation, goodness-of-fit tests for parametric models, equality tests for two-sample problems, and plotting functions.
